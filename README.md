### Prompt
A mission control center usually contains a telemetry and telecommand interface to monitor and command a spacecraft.
The telecommand interface sends commands to the spacecraft, e.g., to perform a specific maneuver.
The telemetry interface displays data points received from the spacecraft, such as information on sensors like temperature.
During mission operation, the operator selects telecommands that should be sent to the spacecraft via a web-based telecommand interface.Â  
The issued telecommands are logged in a database and sent to the spacecraft on the next contact with a ground station.

Every telecommand has a current status. A telecommand usually goes through multiple stages:
    Ready (for Transmission)
    Transmitted
    Acknowledged
    Executed
    Failed (to Execute)


RESTful API microservice (telecommand interface)
A command sender that sends issued commands to the ground station interface
